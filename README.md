## Take a look at my projects!

_Some of them may appear as private as of now due to the my profile still being under construction. I'm sorry!_
### Personal projects
I thought i had a great idea. That's how every single one of these projects started. They were all created with the intention of being used. Some of them actually are!
My personal projects are usually related to one of my hobbies. And trust me, i have lots of hobbies so more projects will come! Feel free to explore or get inspired!

### Learning projects
Learning projects were created with intention of bringing as much educational value as possible. I tried to cover many topics, understand and implement them while also trying to mainain best practises and clean code.
Ideas for some of these projects come either from myself or educational websites like [HyperSkill](hyperskill.com) by JetBrains however all the development is solely my work.
